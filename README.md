## Data Types and Structures

This assignment is part of the iOS course of Codie Academy. Use all the concepts you learnt in the previuous lecture to solve the problem.

## Palindrome

A [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) is a word, number, phrase, or other sequences of characters that remains the same when its characters are reversed, such as:

"madam"
"racecar"
"10801"

Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as:

"Was it a car or a cat I saw?"
"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"

Use the file Palindrome.swift to write a program that checks whether or not an array contains a palindrome. You can use Xcode to test and run your code into a Playground.
